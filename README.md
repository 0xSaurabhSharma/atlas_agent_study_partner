# 🎓 ATLAS: Academic Task & Learning Agent System

![Atlas Workflow Graph](https://github.com/0xSaurabhSharma/atlas_agent_study_partner/blob/master/atlas_workflow_graph.png)


ATLAS is an intelligent multi-agent system designed to provide personalized academic support to students. By leveraging a team of specialized AI agents, ATLAS can analyze a student's unique learning style, manage their schedule, and generate tailored study materials to help them overcome academic challenges. This project serves as a powerful demonstration of coordinated AI, where multiple agents collaborate to solve a complex, real-world problem.

-----

## ⚙️ Core Concept: Multi-Agent Collaboration

The power of ATLAS lies in its multi-agent architecture, orchestrated by **LangGraph**. Instead of a single monolithic AI, ATLAS uses a team of specialists that work together in a coordinated workflow.

### Workflow Diagram

The entire process is modeled as a state machine, ensuring a logical and efficient flow from user request to final output.

### The Flow Explained:

1.  **🧠 Coordinator Agent**: The process begins here. The Coordinator acts as the "team lead," analyzing the student's initial request and academic profile to determine which specialized agents are needed for the task.
2.  **🕵️ Profile Analyzer Agent**: This agent performs a deep dive into the student's learning preferences, strengths, and challenges, creating a rich context for the other agents to use.
3.  **🚀 Parallel Execution**: The graph then branches, running the necessary agent workflows **in parallel**.
      * **📅 Planner Agent**: Analyzes the student's calendar and tasks to create an optimized, actionable study schedule.
      * **📝 Notewriter Agent**: Summarizes course material and generates study notes tailored to the student's learning style.
      * **👩‍🏫 Advisor Agent**: Provides strategic advice, stress management techniques, and personalized study tips.
4.  **🤝 Joiner Node**: This node acts as a synchronization point, waiting for all parallel agent workflows to complete their work.
5.  **✅ End**: Once all tasks are finished, the graph concludes, and the combined results are presented to the user.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project uses a modern, robust tech stack designed for building scalable AI applications.

  * **Orchestration**: `LangGraph` - The core engine for defining and running the multi-agent workflow as a state machine.
  * **LLM Integration**: `LangChain` - Provides a standardized interface for interacting with various Large Language Models.
  * **Web Framework**: `FastAPI` - Used to build the robust, asynchronous API that serves the agent logic.
  * **Frontend**: `Streamlit` - For creating a user-friendly, interactive web interface where users can input their data and see results in real-time.
  * **Configuration**: `Pydantic` & `python-dotenv` - For robust and secure management of environment variables and settings.
  * **LLM Providers**: Flexible architecture supporting models from OpenAI, Google, Groq, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the ATLAS system running on your local machine.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd atlas_project
```

### 2\. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory (`atlas_project/`) and add your API keys.

  * **File:** `.env`
  * **Content:**
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    GROQ_API_KEY="gsk_..."
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIza..."
    # Add any other keys required by your config.yml
    ```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4\. Run the Application

The application is powered by Streamlit. Run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Your browser will automatically open to the ATLAS web interface, where you can interact with the agent system.

## 🔮 Future Work

This project serves as a strong foundation for a more advanced system. Future plans include:

  * **Long-Term Memory**: Integrating a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, ChromaDB) to give the agents memory of past interactions.
  * **Voice Agent**: Adding speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities for a hands-free user experience.
  * **Database Integration**: Migrating from static JSON files to a robust SQL database for managing user profiles and tasks.
